    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s been two weeks since I graduated from Dev Bootcamp, and it’s been three months since I left my job in St. Louis to come to Chicago and learn to code. It’s been an exciting journey. I’ve learned more than I thought possible, made some amazing friends, explored the city, and most importantly - I’ve never looked back.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve graduated, it feels awkward to be at loose ends. Dev Bootcamp held such a structure for me that even being home for anything more than an hour of awake time is a strange feeling. It’s sad to leave the environment at Dev Bootcamp because I’m now responsible for pushing <em>myself</em> to grow as a coder, whereas before I felt as if I was learning by osmosis just by being in the space with how much energy exists there.</p>

<p>I’ve been trying to code as much as possible, usually around four hours a day. My first outlet is <a href="http://www.exercism.io">exercism</a>. Exercism provides challenges that take approximately 30 minutes a piece and are accompanied by a test suite. The real benefit, however, is the community aspect to the site. Participants are encouraged to “nitpick” other’s code in order to provide advice on refactoring. The community as a whole places a high value on writing object oriented code broken up into methods with a single responsbility, as opposed to what could be a simpler, functional answer. I value that sort of approach because I believe it will make me a stronger coder when I enter the workforce. Code that makes up a larger code base needs to be modular so that it’s easy to maintain and refactor.</p>

<p>In addition to vanilla coding exercises, I attended the Science Hack Day hackathon at the Adler Planetarium this last weekend. I ended up on a team with two fellow Dev Bootcamp graduates, two freshmen computer science students from Northwestern, and a PhD astronomer. We created a web app named StarChild that accepts a person’s age, weight, and location, and then produces a number of interesting trivia analogous to that person’s relationship with the universe. For instance, based on a person’s age, the app calculates the number of stars close enough to Earth whose light has had the time to reach them. Based on a person’s weight, the app calculates the energy an individual has by virtue of being on the Earth and revolving around the Sun, but in interesting units, e.g.: atomic bombs, lightning bolts, candy bars. What’s most exciting, however, is that our entry won the judge’s choice award. I won a bunch of planetarium nick-nacks like a paper weight and some books, as well as a Github tshirt. I’m mostly excited about the tshirt, to be perfectly honest. You can check out the source <a href="https://github.com/nealcpeters/StarChild">here</a>.</p>

<p>I’m working on a simple Rails site I’m hoping to deploy over the next couple days. It’s a fun project I’ve been working on with my friend and roommate dedicated to happiness. Surely we can all use more of that.</p>
