<div class="entry-content"><p>I love adventure and spontaneity. On more than one occassion in my life I have left everything behind in order to do new things and see where they lead me. I have long-term life plans that also incorporates throwing myself into scenarios that have no predictable or guaranteed outcome.</p>

<p>Despite that facet of my personality, I am a creature of routine and habit. My days lately have fallen into a regular rhythm, and it has been incredibly therapeutic.</p>

<p>I wake up every morning around 7:30 and run. This alone has been welcome because I had no time while attending Dev Bootcamp. When I’m done running, I’ll shower, dress, and sit down for 10 minutes in order to meditate and focus my mind for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>Next, I sit down at the computer to make a list of things I want to accomplish. I put a lot of little things on the list, like “get the mail”, but it helps build momentum to check things off the list, and they’re still things that need to get done.</p>

<p>The list always includes coding, which I generally do in the morning. I make it a habit to write code, learn something new, and push to Github on a daily basis. Lately I’ve been learning Angular, which goes with an over-arching theme of Javascript practice in general.</p>

<p>I eat lunch around noon, and then it’s time to hunt for jobs, read tech-related news, and stay on top of the job search. This is my full time job at the moment, but I’d say I realistically only spend approximately 30 hours a week on it. I spend another 30 hours coding, which is, in my opinion, just as important a facet of the job hunt as actually applying for jobs. </p>

<p>All of those combined activities should lead me to around 6:00pm, at which time I eat dinner and start reading. I love classic literature, and I’ve had the time lately to read a number of books, including <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>, <em>Lord of the Flies</em>, and <em>The Stranger</em>, among others. Sitting on my back porch on a spring evening and reading a book while the sun goes down is one of my greatest pleasures.</p>

<p>I’ll read through the night, or code, or maybe watch a little TV until around midnight, when it’s time to sleep and prepare to do it all over again the next day.</p>

<p>I suppose this routine is no different than the general structure people get into when they have a full time job, it’s just felt different because I’ve spent a lot of time at home. Regardless, this rhythm has been peaceful. Most importantly, every day has produced a healthier (through regular exercise), smarter (through regular coding), and learned (through regular reading of classic literature) Neal. Life should always be about making these routine improvements.</p>
